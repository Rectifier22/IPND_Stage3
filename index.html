    <h2>Lesson 3 - Adding Style to Structure with CSS</h2>

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=3_1>CSS</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a set of rules to describe the formating of elements. When CSS is used, it allows a programmer to reduce code to describe how each element is displayed by referencing a specific style sheet to obtain the attribute for the
          element.
          <p>
            The term <em>cascading</em> is important as CSS utilizes <em>Most Specific Rule Applies.</em> This method is also referred to as <em>inheritance.</em>
            <p>One of the <span class="note">GREATEST</span> assets derrived from using CSS is the ability for the programmer to avoid repetition within the code!
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=3_2>Inheritance</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        Wikipedia describes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">Inheritance</a> as <em>the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.</em> This functionality
        is made possible by the &quot;Tree-Like&quot; structure mentioned earlier. Each element will inherit specific rules from it&#39;s &quot;ancestor&quot; or element it has been &quot;nested&quot; within. Wikipedia goes on to say, &quot;descendant
        elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited.&quot;
        <p>
          According to wikipedia, examples of inherited properties are:
          <ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Font</li>
            <li>Letter-spacing</li>
            <li>Line-height</li>
            <li>List-style</li>
            <li>Text-align</li>
            <li>Text-indent</li>
            <li>Text-transform</li>
            <li>Visibility</li>
            <li>White-space</li>
            <li>Word-spacing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Examples of properties NOT inherited are:
            <ul>
              <li>Background</li>
              <li>Border</li>
              <li>Display</li>
              <li>Float and Clear</li>
              <li>Height and Width</li>
              <li>Margin</li>
              <li>Min- and Max-height and Width</li>
              <li>Outline</li>
              <li>Overflow</li>
              <li>Padding</li>
              <li>Position</li>
              <li>Text-decoration</li>
              <li>Vertical-align</li>
              <li>Z-index</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When using CSS a programmer will utilize selectors and define attributes. Selector - Defines the elements to apply the style
              <p>
                A programmer can assign a style by selecting the elements by tag or even by class.
                <p>
                  Style format is &quot;Attribute&quot; : &quot;Value&quot;
                  <p>
                    P {
                    <br> Color:Red
                    <br> }
                    <p>
                      IMPORTANT: A great link to CSS References is found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
                      <p>
                        How do I include CSS Styling in my web page? here are three ways you can do this.
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Method 1:</b> write CSS in the "&lt;head>" of your HTML Inside the &lt;head> element, add a &lt;style> element. Write your CSS in the &lt;style> element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.</li>

                          <li><b>Method 2:</b> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this: 1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html).
                            2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. 3. Add a &lt;head> element to the top of your HTML. 4. Add a &lt;link> tag inside the &lt;head> element. Since &lt;link> is a "void tag" you don't need
                            to add a closing &lt;/link>. 5. Add the following attributes to your &lt;link>: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"</li>

                          <li><b>Method 3:</b> Write your style inline with your HTML This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it.</li>
                        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=3_3>Divs, Spans, Classes, Ids</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <ul>
          <li>Use Divs to control layout. Div tags bump things to the next line.</li>
          <li>Use Spans to control style without affecting the layout.</li>
          <li>ID provides a method to uniquely identify an element. Two elements within the page cannot the same ID.</li>
          <li>Classes are used for many items on a page that wl be styled similarly.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=3_4>Diagram of the Box</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
        <br>- ->Margin &#45; Clears the area around the border and is transparent. &quot;Space between boxes&quot;
        <br>--- ->Border &#45; Inherited from the Color property of the box
        <br>----- ->Padding &#45; Clears the area arounf the content and is affected by the background color of the box
        <br>-------- ->Content &#45; Image or text that appears on the website
        <p>
          There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
          <br>1. Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.
          <br>2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.
          <p>
            1. Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
            <br>2. Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.

      <div class="subject-title" id=6_1>Functions</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        According to webopedia, a <b>function</b> is a type of <b>procedure</b> or <b>routine</b>. Some programming languages make a distinction between a <b>function</b>, which returns a value, and a <b>procedure</b>, which performs some operation but
        does not return a value. Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library.

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=6_2>How to Make a Function</div>
      <div class="subject-text">

        A function (aka procedure) is comprised of a procedure and operands (or arguments)
        <br> procedure> (input>, input>, ...)
        <br> Operands or Arguments
        <p>
          When making a function (or procedure), the function must first be defined. To do this, we use the keyword "def". The def statement is then followed by the name of the function. Finally, th function parameters are listed in parentheses. The parameters
          are empty values until the function is called at a later time in the code.
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must begin the line with def (lowercase)</li>
              <li>After def you must give a function name.</li>
              <li>Next, you must have a set of parentheses with the required parameters inside.</li>
              <li>The line must end with a : colon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Example:
              <br>def rest_of_string (s) :
              <br> return s[1:]
              <p>
                <div class="note">Note: The RETURN statement is extremely IMPORTANT! If a return is not included in the building of the function, no value will be output.</div>

      <div class="subject-title" id=6_3>How to Use a Function</div>

      <div class="subject-text">
        According to <a href="www.openbookproject.net"> OpenBookproject.net</a>, creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command and
        by using English words in place of arcane code.

        FUNCTIONS ALLOWPROGRAMMERS TO AVOID REPETITION
        <p>
          According to Adam at Udacity.com, "Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've defined a function once, you never have to define it again."
          <p>
            According to OpenBookProject.net, creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. For example, a short way to print nine consecutive new lines is to call three_lines three times.
            <p>
              <div class="example_code">def say_hello(name):

        <br>
        <br>Mutation means that we can alter asingle element within a list without haing to create an entirely new list.
        <br>Example:

        <br>p[0]='Y'

          Another example of Mutation of a List:

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_1>Object Oriented Programming</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <br>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is basically programming by using objects. The objects communicate with each other by sending messages. The programmer defines objects to manipulate by use of a Class. Objects are actually instances of the class
        or subclasses, each with attributes and methods. The programmer will expect an input, then have the objects interract with each other and change variables to produce a desired output. Common languages that utilize Object Oriented Programming are
        Python, Java, Perl, C++, and PHP.
        <p>
          A great description of OOP, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZqLEDH0x7A">Object Oriented Programming for Dummies</a>, by Anthony Bucyk and Joseph Lersch
          <p>
            Defining a function and calling a single function multiple times throughout the program will reduce or eliminate uneccessary duplicate code. Additionally, by using the concept of inheritance, the programmer can further reduce duplicate code by sharing
            attributes within classes and subclasses.

            <p><span class="note">NOTE:</span>A function within a class is also called a "Method".

              <p>

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_2>Abstraction</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <br>The whole concept of Object Oriented Programming is to "abstract" the more intricate code required to "make things work" and allow the programmer to simply think in terms of objects and manipulation of those objects.
        <p>
          According to Whatis.com - In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order
          to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. (whatis.techtarget.com/definition/abstraction)

        <br>Maintenance
        <br>Reusability
        <br>Modifiability
        <p>
          The benefits of using OOP for large programming projects is that is allows code to be reused thoughout the program, the code is easily modified, and maintenance by various programmers can be easily achived due to the inherent nature of the way the code
          is written. For instance, any programmer familiar with OOP can look at another programmer's code to determine what attributes and behaviors are found within a class. The programmer can further analyze and identify the various classes and subclass
          relationships.

    <div class="subject">
      <div class="subject-title" id=11_4>OOP as it relates to HTML and CSS</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <br>The easiest connection to make between OOP and HTML and CSS is by viewing how a programmer can use ABSTRACTION &#40;Abstract Thinking&#41; to  reduce the amount of HTML code simply by using a CSS file to contain formatting and behavioral attributes about a class of text. For example, a CSS
        file could designate Classes such as "Header", "Title", and "Description" each with its own unique font color, size, behavior, etc. To create all of the code in one single file would be quite lengthy to provide code for each attribute each time
        it is needed in HTML. By using CSS, the programmer only has to identify the specified class by its name from within the associated CSS file, then all the attributes are applied by HTML.
        <br>
        <br>
          Cascading Style Sheets by very nature exhibit similarity to Object Oriented Programming by means of inheritance.  Just as Objects and derived classes inherit attributes from parent or superclasses, CSS employs this same concept of passing attributes &#40;Most Specific Rule Applies&#41;. Strategic placement of attributes allows the programmer to reduce the amount of code as attributes are inherited.

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_5>Vocabulary of Common Terms used with OOP</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <p>
          <b>Encapsulation</b> - is term used for combining data and behaviors of an object into the "black box" often referred to in OOP.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Method</b> - is simply a defined function belonging to an Object defined within a Class that can be called.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Module</b> - A module is nothing more than a set of functions and varibles within a file. The aspects of a module can be imported by another file for use within that file.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Library</b> - A library in OOP often contains standard modules built for various commonly used functions that can simply be imported for use by the programmer.  A programmer can also create their own library and even utilize newly created modules.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Class</b> - A "class" is a set of specific instructions that include various attribute parameters that can be used and is designed to create an "instance" of an object. A class can have data and methods.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Object</b> – Data Structures that are comprised of attributes and methods &#40;procedures&#41;. An object procedure can be used to modify an attribute of the same object.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Instance</b> - An "instance" is an actual object that has been initialized and created based on the specifications outlined in the associated "class". An "instance" can be customized uniquely from other instances created from the same "class".
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Constructor</b> - When an instance is created, the "Constructor" of the Class is called and is also the "__INIT__" method. The constructor uses the keyword "SELF" which represents itself or the instance being created.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Self</b> - When a constructor is called from the class, "self" refers to the instance of the class being created.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Instance Variable</b> - All of the variables associated with an instance are called "instance variables". These are unique to the variable and can be accesed from within the class can be accessed with the keyword "self". Outside the class,
          the instance variables can be accessed by using the actual instance name when outside the class.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Instance Method</b> - All functions that are defined inside a class are associated with an instance, and include the first argument as "self".
          <br>
          <br> It is good practice to keep Class definition in a separate file and only call or use the class from another file.

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_6>Classes</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <p>When classes are called the "init" or initialize function is actually called that creates space within memory for a new instance of the Class.

          <p>What is a class? A "class" is a set of specific instructions that include various attribute parameters that can be used and is designed to create an "instance" of an object.

            <p>What is an instance of a class? An "instance" is an actual object that has been initialized and created based on the specifications outlined in the associated "class". An “instance” can be customized uniquely from other instances created from
              the same "class".

              <p>Classes are like blueprints that contain information about an object Multiple instances of a Class can be created from from this "blueprint".

                <p>Another analogy to explain classes and their instances would be how an automobile manufacturer details all of the requirements and specifications to manufacture a specific vehicle model. These specifications would be analogous to the "class".

                  <p>An "instance" in this automobile analogy would be how a buyer could customize the color, interior upgrades, stereo, engine size, and various other options and actually have the vehicle made. The customized actual vehicle would be considered
                    the "instance".
                    
                    <p> A wise friend from Udacity, Stacy, provided another analogy for me as follows &#40;WARNING - May Make You Hungry&#41;:
                      <p>
                        "Another good example is that class, object, and instance align with cookie cutter, shaped cookie, and a particular cookie. A cookie cutter is meant to create cookies of a certain shape &#40;maybe a star shape&#41;. So you end up with star-shaped cookies &#40;objects&#41; from it. But maybe this cookie I pick up &#40;an instance&#41; is made with chocolate-chip cookie dough, while maybe this other one &#40;another instance&#41; is made with peanut butter cookie dough."

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_7>Variables</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <p>Variables can be defined at multiple levels when using classes. Varibles specific to an instance of a class should be defined within the instance. Varibles that will be shared among many instances should be defined at the Class level.

          <p>In Python, some Classes come with pre-defined class variables. One such variable is "__doc__". When "__doc__" is called, the program will search for any text found within the triple qoutes (i.e. """xxxxx""").

            <p>Additional pre-defined class variables are __name__ and __module__.

      <div class="subject-title" id=11_8>Inheritance</div>
      <div class="subject-text">
        <p>
          Inheritance is the concept that attributes are passed from the parent instance to the child instance. The child instance can also have unique attributes and in some programming languages,inherit attributes from more than one parent class to which the
          child instance belongs.
          <p>
            <span class="note">NOTE:</span> The parent class is sometimes called the Superclass or Base Class, while the child class is sometimes called the subclass or derived class.
            <p>
              The principles of inheritance can allow certain variables placed at appropriate levels reduce the need to have all the variables held at the instance levels. Additionally, child classes can be placed within an existing parent class and inherit varibles
              thus reducing the need to repeat variables at the child level.

        <p>Methods can also appear within parent and child classes. When a method in the child (or sub class) is called by the same name as it is within the parent class, this is called Method Overriding. The programmer can specify to ignore the inherited
          method and use only the method as it is called within the subclass.

                        <p><b>Open</b> &#45; Opens a file from a location on the computer
                          <br> Example: <span class="example_code">quotes = open("C:\dtect_profanity\movie_quotes.txt")</span>
                          <br> Open is actually a Python Built-In function. When called it actually executes "init" to create an "object" of "file" (This is similar to creating objects of "Class".)
                          <p><b>Read</b> &#45; Reads the contents of a text file that has been opened by the program.
                            <br> Example: <span class="example_code">contents_of_file = quotes.read()
            <br>	Print (contents_of_file)</span>
                            <p><b>Close</b> &#45; Closes a file that has been opened by the program
                              <br>Example: <span class="example_code">quotes..close()</span>
                              <p><span class="note">Note:</span> It is good convention to close programs that your program has opened.
                                <p>

          <span class="example_code">Webbrowser.open (python)</span> This is a function that takes any web link you enter and open the browser within python.
          <br><b>Example:</b>
          <br><span class="example_code">webbrowser.open(“http:www.youttube.com”)</span>
          <p>
            <span class="example_code">time.sleep(10)</span> This function causes the program to wait a specified number of seconds.
            <p>
              You have to Import the webbrowser function before it can be used. To do so, add the statement:
              <br><span class="example_code">import webbrowser</span>
              <br><span class="example_code">import time</span>
              <p>
                Use <span class="example_code">ctrl + c</span> within the IDLE Python window if you want to stop the current program from running.
                <p>
                  <span class="example_code">os.rename(src, dst)</span>
                  <br>Rename the file or directory src to dst.
                  <p>
                    <span class="example_code">os.getcwd</span>
                    <br>This function gets the name of the current working directory.
                    <p>

        <p>
          The Google Style Guide provides conventions to programmers around the world regarding how to maintain desired conventions for various programming languages.
          <p>
            For example, the Google Style Guide for Python recommends that when defining a class, the first letter should be capitalized. This is not a requirement in python, but rather a preference published by Google.
            <p>
              Here is the link to the <a href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html">Google Style Guide for Python</a>
              <p>
                Additionally, the Google Style Guide for Python also recommends that when a variable is going to remain constant, (i.e. the Movie Ratings in the Udacity Movie trailer project, the variable should be defined using ALL CAPS.
                <p>
                  Example:
                  <span class="example_code">VALID_RATINGS = ["G", "PG", "PG-13", "R"]</span>
